# Particle Identification of ALICE data from 2010

in 2010 ALICE collected data which samples 200000 electrons, pions, kaons, protons and deutrons. These particles were acquired through various techniques like $\mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm{S}} \rightarrow \pi ^{+} \pi^{-}$ decays for pions, $\Lambda \rightarrow \mathrm{p} \pi^{-}$ decays for protons, $\mathrm{K}^{+} \rightarrow \mu^{+} \nu_{\mu}$'s kink topology for kaons, $\gamma \rightarrow \mathrm{e}^{+} \mathrm{e}^{-}$ for electrons and deutrons were selected via tim-of-flight detectors. Recognizing which particle is which from collisions is important for data analysis. Thus the goal of this project is to build a multiclass classifier that is able to predict what the identity is of a particle in new data. We have tested various classifiers and optimzed the best classifier in our project.
